I am a sophomore studying computer science and math at University of Wisconsin. I am particularly interested in
artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies, which I believe are the cornerstone of tomorrow's technology.
I am continually learning and working on projects, and open to opportunities in research and software.

Born and raised in the San Francisco Bay area, I am an avid Warriors and 49ers fan. In my free time, I love to
go to the gym, grab food, and hang out with my friends.
